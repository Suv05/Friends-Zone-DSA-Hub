# Contributing to Friends Zone DSA Hub

Welcome to Friends Zone DSA Club! ðŸŽ‰  
This repository is for practicing DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) together. Follow the steps below to contribute your solutions to the repository.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository to Your Local Machine
1. In your GitHub fork, click on the **Code** button, and copy the URL (SSH or HTTPS).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-fork-url>
    ```
3. Navigate into the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd friends-zone-dsa-club
    ```

## Step 3: Create a New Branch
1. Create a new branch with your name (this is optional but recommended to keep your changes organized):
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-name-branch>
    ```
2. Navigate into the folder on your name:
    ```bash
    cd <your-named-folder>
    ```
3.Now start coding. Add your DSA practice code or solution files in this folder.

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes
1. Stage your changes:
    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```
2. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added <your-name>'s DSA practice solutions"
    ```

## Step 6: Push the Changes to Your Fork
1. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to the original repository (our main DSA repo) on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
3. Click **New Pull Request**.
4. Select your branch from the dropdown on the right.
5. Review your changes and create the Pull Request (PR) with a meaningful title (e.g., "Added <your-name>'s folder and DSA solutions").

## Step 8: Merge the Pull Request
Since you have write access, you can merge your own PR:
1. After your PR is created, you will see a **Merge** button.
2. Click on **Merge Pull Request** to merge your changes into the main branch.
3. After merging, delete your branch on GitHub.

## Step 9: Pull the Latest Changes from Master (Optional)
To keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes, you should occasionally pull from the main repository:
1. Switch to the `master` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
2. Pull the latest changes:
    ```bash
    git pull origin master
    ```
