# Contributing to Friends Zone DSA Hub

Welcome to Friends Zone DSA Club! 🎉  
This repository is for practicing DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) together. Follow the steps below to contribute your solutions to the repository.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository to Your Local Machine
1. In your GitHub fork, click on the **Code** button, and copy the URL (SSH or HTTPS).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-fork-url>
    ```
3. Navigate into the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd friends-zone-dsa-club
    ```

## Step 3: Create a New Branch
1. Create a new branch with your name (this is optional but recommended to keep your changes organized):
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-name-branch>
    ```
2. Navigate into the folder on your name:
    ```bash
    cd <your-named-folder>
    ```
3.Now start coding. Add your DSA practice code or solution files in this folder.

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes
1. Stage your changes:
    ```bash
    git add -A
    ```
2. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added <your-name>'s DSA practice solutions"
    ```

## Step 6: Push the Changes to Your Fork
1. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to the original repository (our main DSA repo) on GitHub.
2. Click on the **Pull Requests** tab.
3. Click **New Pull Request**.
4. Select your branch from the dropdown on the right.
5. Review your changes and create the Pull Request (PR) with a meaningful title (e.g., "Added <your-name>'s folder and DSA solutions").

## Step 8: Merge the Pull Request
Since you have write access, you can merge your own PR:
1. After your PR is created, you will see a **Merge** button.
2. Click on **Merge Pull Request** to merge your changes into the main branch.
3. After merging, delete your branch on GitHub.

## Step 9: Pull the Latest Changes from Master (Optional)
To keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes, you should occasionally pull from the main repository:
1. Switch to the `master` branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout master
    ```
2. Pull the latest changes:
    ```bash
    git pull origin master
    ```
